**H**arbour **Q**tContribs **L**ayer

HQL is a xBase library; it is a layer between xBase sources and [QtContribs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qtcontribs/) library (xBase binding to [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) framework).
HQL must be compiled with [Harbour](https://harbour.github.io/).
For this reason where [Harbour](https://harbour.github.io/) and [QtContribs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qtcontribs/) can be installed, compiled and run, HQL can be used.

You can get subsequent updates using this command:
`git pull`

* Alternative
Click on button [Clone](https://github.com/l3w/hql.git) at the top right.

## How to Build

*WARNING:* always keep in sync the C toolchain, with the same or upper version used to build Harbour and QtContribs. For this reason, I suggest to build Harbour and QtContribs by your self. To build Harbour and QtContribs follow their documentation.

#### Preferred way
Copy/expand HQL within Harbour tree under 'addons' directory 
```
harbour
+- addons
   +- hql
```

Enter Harbour 'hbmk2' command
```console
cd harbour/addons/hql
hbmk2 hql
```
*as suggestion, redirect STDOUT & STDERR to file*
```console
cd harbour/addons/hql
hbmk2 hql >errorlog.txt 2>&1
```
#### Alternative
Copy/expand HQL in your preferred path. Enter Harbour 'hbmk2' command
```console
cd yourHQLpath
hbmk2 hql
```

Copy to *harbour/addons/hql* directory:
- [x] 'include' directory
- [x] 'lib' directoy
- [x] *.hbc files

#### Build examples
HQL has a rich examples directory. To build each program, enter Harbour 'hbmk2' command in each directory; e.g.
```console
cd ...hql/samples/pushbutton
hbmk2 oop001
```
*WARNING:* sometimes, example need icons, images, fonts, translations, etc. has *external resources*. You need to copy these subfolders/files along with executable program.

## Get Help
ASAP will be defined.
